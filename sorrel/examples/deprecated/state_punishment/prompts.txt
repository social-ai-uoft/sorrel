Please rewrite the game of state_punishment to be of similar style like treasurehunt and cleanup and staghunt. You can first summarize the key components in state punishment, recheck with the game, refine the summary until you think it is okay. Then propose a plan of implementing the game similar to the style of other games. And you need to refine the plan. Then you can implement the plan to code. Note: (1) You should allow whether the agent is using composite views & composite actions in the main.py (2) agent can see the current level of punishment (3) add a noob action (doing nothing)
