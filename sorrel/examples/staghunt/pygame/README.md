# Stag Hunt Pygame

A comprehensive pygame implementation of the Stag Hunt game from the Sorrel framework. This allows human players to experience the stag hunt social dilemma game using keyboard controls, with both single-agent and multi-agent turn-based gameplay modes.

## Game Overview

Stag Hunt is a classic social dilemma game where players must choose between two strategies:
- **Stag Strategy**: Cooperate with others for higher rewards (4 points if both choose stag)
- **Hare Strategy**: Play it safe alone for guaranteed moderate rewards (2 points if both choose hare)

The game features resource collection, agent orientation, strategic interactions, and proper agent lifecycle management (frozen ‚Üí removed ‚Üí respawned).

## Features

### üéÆ **Core Gameplay**
- **Human-controlled gameplay**: Use keyboard controls to move, turn, and interact
- **Multi-agent support**: Play with 1-4 agents in turn-based mode
- **Exact Sorrel replication**: Uses the same sprites, ASCII maps, and game logic as the original framework
- **Turn-based system**: Agents take turns with keyboard-controlled timing

### üé® **Visual Features**
- **Exact sprite rendering**: Uses the same PNG sprites as the original Sorrel game
- **ASCII map support**: Loads and displays the exact same ASCII map layouts
- **Agent orientation**: Visual arrows showing which direction agents are facing
- **Real-time UI**: Live score tracking, turn counting, and agent status display

### üèÜ **Game Mechanics**
- **Resource collection**: Collect stag (red circles) and hare (green squares) resources
- **Strategic interactions**: Fire interaction beams to engage with other agents
- **Inventory management**: Track collected resources and readiness status
- **Proper agent lifecycle**: Frozen ‚Üí Removed ‚Üí Respawned cycle
- **Dual reward system**: Both agents receive rewards from interactions
- **Configurable parameters**: Customizable arena sizes, tile sizes, FPS, and turn duration

## Installation

Make sure you have pygame installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game

### üöÄ **Quick Start - ASCII Map Version (Recommended)**

Run the enhanced ASCII map version with multiple agents:

```bash
python staghunt_ascii_pygame.py --agents 2
```

**Command line options:**
- `--agents N`: Number of agents (1-4, default: 1)
- `--tile-size N`: Tile size in pixels (16-64, default: 32)
- `--fps N`: Game speed (5-30, default: 10)
- `--turn-duration N`: Turn duration in frames (10-60, default: 30)

### üéÆ **Multi-Agent Launcher**

Use the interactive launcher for easy configuration:

```bash
python run_multi_agent.py
```

This provides pre-configured options:
- **2 Agents**: Fast-paced gameplay
- **3 Agents**: Balanced strategy
- **4 Agents**: Complex multi-agent dynamics
- **Custom**: Configure all parameters yourself

### üìä **Original Versions**

**Basic Pygame (Random Generation):**
```bash
python staghunt_pygame.py
```

**Interactive Launcher (Arena Sizes):**
```bash
python run_staghunt_pygame.py
```

Options:
- Small Arena (8x8)
- Medium Arena (11x11) - Default
- Large Arena (15x15)
- Custom Arena (you specify the dimensions)

## Controls

### üéÆ **Movement & Actions**
- **W/S**: Move forward/backward relative to your orientation
- **A/D**: Step left/right relative to your orientation
- **Q/E**: Turn left/right (change orientation)
- **SPACE**: Interact (fire interaction beam)
- **ESC**: Quit game

### üîÑ **Multi-Agent Controls**
- **TAB**: Switch between agents (in non-turn-based mode)
- **ENTER**: End turn manually (in turn-based mode)
- **Any Key**: Advance turn when agent is frozen

## Game Elements

### üéØ **Visual Elements**
- **Blue Circle with Arrow**: Your player character (arrow shows orientation)
- **Red Circles**: Stag resources (rare, high value)
- **Green Squares**: Hare resources (common, moderate value)
- **Gray Squares**: Walls (cannot pass through)
- **Beige Background**: Sand terrain (walkable surface)
- **White Overlay**: Interaction beams (temporary)
- **Yellow Squares**: Spawn points

### üìä **UI Elements**
- **Turn Counter**: Shows current full turn and individual agent actions
- **Score Display**: Individual agent scores and total score
- **Agent Status**: Current agent, inventory, position, and orientation
- **Action Status**: "Press any key to take action", "FROZEN", "REMOVED", etc.

## Game Rules

### üéÆ **Basic Gameplay**
1. **Movement**: Use W/S to move forward/backward, A/D to step sideways
2. **Orientation**: Use Q/E to turn left/right - this affects movement direction
3. **Resource Collection**: Walk over resources to collect them
4. **Inventory**: Collect both stag and hare resources to become "ready"
5. **Interactions**: Use SPACE to fire an interaction beam when ready
6. **Strategy**: Your strategy is determined by which resource type you have more of

### üèÜ **Scoring System**
- **Taste Rewards**: 0.1 points for each resource collected
- **Interaction Rewards**: Based on payoff matrix
- **Bonus Rewards**: 1.0 point for participating in interactions
- **Payoff Matrix**:
  - Both choose Stag: 4 points each
  - Both choose Hare: 2 points each
  - Mixed choice: 0 points for Stag player, 2 points for Hare player

### üîÑ **Agent Lifecycle (Multi-Agent Mode)**
1. **Active**: Agent can move and interact normally
2. **Frozen**: After interaction, agent cannot act for 5 frames
3. **Removed**: Agent disappears from board for 10 frames
4. **Respawned**: Agent reappears at random spawn point
5. **Active**: Agent can act normally again

## Strategy Tips

### üéØ **Basic Strategies**
- **Stag Strategy**: Collect more stag resources than hare resources
- **Hare Strategy**: Collect more hare resources than stag resources
- **Timing**: Wait for the right moment to interact with other agents
- **Positioning**: Use your orientation to aim your interaction beam effectively

### ü§ù **Multi-Agent Strategies**
- **Cooperation**: Both agents benefit from stag-stag interactions (4 points each)
- **Risk Management**: Consider if other agents will cooperate or defect
- **Timing**: Coordinate interactions when both agents are ready
- **Resource Balance**: Maintain inventory balance for optimal strategy flexibility

## Configuration

You can modify the game configuration by editing the `config` dictionary:

```python
config = {
    "world": {
        "height": 11,                    # Arena height
        "width": 11,                     # Arena width
        "num_agents": 1,                 # Number of agents (currently only 1 human)
        "resource_density": 0.15,        # Probability of resource spawning
        "taste_reward": 0.1,             # Reward for collecting resources
        "destroyable_health": 3,         # Health of resources (zap hits to destroy)
        "beam_length": 3,                # Length of interaction beam
        "beam_radius": 1,                # Radius of interaction beam
        "beam_cooldown": 3,              # Turns before beam can be used again
        "respawn_lag": 10,               # Turns before resources can respawn
        "payoff_matrix": [[4, 0], [2, 2]], # Stag Hunt payoff matrix
        "interaction_reward": 1.0,       # Bonus for participating in interaction
        "freeze_duration": 5,            # Turns agent is frozen after interaction
        "respawn_delay": 10,             # Turns before agent respawns
    },
    "display": {
        "cell_size": 50,                 # Size of each grid cell in pixels
        "fps": 10,                       # Game speed (frames per second)
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### üêõ **Common Issues**

**Game won't start:**
1. Make sure pygame is installed: `pip install pygame`
2. Make sure you're running from the correct directory
3. Check that all sorrel dependencies are available
4. Try running with fewer agents if performance is slow

**Visual issues:**
1. **Black screen**: Make sure you're using `staghunt_ascii_pygame.py` for the enhanced version
2. **Missing sprites**: Check that the `assets/` folder contains the PNG files
3. **ASCII map not loading**: Ensure `docs/stag_hunt_ascii_map_clean.txt` exists

**Multi-agent issues:**
1. **Agents not switching**: Use TAB key in non-turn-based mode
2. **Frozen agents stuck**: Press any key to advance turns
3. **Score not updating**: Both agents should receive rewards from interactions

### ‚ö° **Performance Tips**
- Use smaller tile sizes (16-32) for better performance
- Lower FPS (5-10) for slower, more controlled gameplay
- Use fewer agents (1-2) for simpler gameplay
