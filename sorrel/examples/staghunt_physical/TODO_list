1. agents need to have individual specific representation
2. Action space: movement, attach, (punishment/control)
3. New attributes of resources: reward allocation radius (also a method, not sure if in entity, reward_allocation(self, radius, world))
3. Hunting: Agent will attach (beam) the resources, and the resource has certain level of health, if become 0, it will be regarded as hunted. 
But the resource will also restore its health X points/turn. The stag has a larger restoration speed while the hare is smaller.
4. Reward allocation: after a resource is considered as hunted, reward will be distributed to agents within the region of the depleted resource.
For example, with the resource being the center, a radius of Y defines the distribution region.


Description:
So the idea is that agents move around in a world with two types of resources, hares and stags. Each turn they can either move, attack a resource, or use a punishment/control action if we include it. Resources have health that ticks down when attacked and regenerates over time. The key twist is that stags have much higher health than hares, so a single agent can’t bring one down on their own — it really takes several agents attacking together before the regeneration outpaces them. Once a resource’s health drops to zero, it’s considered hunted, and the reward gets shared among all agents within a certain radius around where it fell (this allows for potential free-riding, where agents benefit from rewards without contributing to the attack, if attack is costly). That setup forces agents to make interesting choices: whether to go for the easy solo option, try to coordinate on a stag for a bigger payoff, or even use punishment to discourage free-riding.
