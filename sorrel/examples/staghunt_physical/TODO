1. agents need to have individual specific representation
2. Action space: movement, attach, (punishment/control)
3. New attributes of resources: reward allocation radius (also a method, not sure if in entity, reward_allocation(self, radius, world))
3. Hunting: Agent will attach (beam) the resources, and the resource has certain level of health, if become 0, it will be regarded as hunted. 
But the resource will also restore its health X points/turn. The stag has a larger restoration speed while the hare is smaller.
4. Reward allocation: after a resource is considered as hunted, reward will be distributed to agents within the region of the depleted resource.
For example, with the resource being the center, a radius of Y defines the distribution region.
