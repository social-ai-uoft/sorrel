# Rationale

We propose that the representation geometry, which influences generalization and even social dynamics, will be influence by the properties of coordination demand.

If the coordination requires agents to achieve shared representation of the ecological environment, then a potential solution is to discover the latent structure of the percepts.

We will also add individual-specific noise to the observations and manipulate the strength of the noise.

# Implementation

To achieve that, we can use two setup. (1) The ingroup bias setup, where agents need to coordinate on which types of resources they should collect (2) The staghunt physical setup, where agents need to achieve common intention about which resource to collectively target at.

# Hypotheses

(1) Requiring agents to achieve similarity along the defined latents would increase in-group baises
(2) Requiring agents to achieve shared representations (what are similar, what are different), even without direct usage of the latents, would incur better generalization and ingroup baises
(3) even requiring coordination on one dimension would still cause generalization and biases in all dimensions

# implications

(1) Previous accounts of biases suggest resource-rational analysis. Here, they’re the necessary geometric byproducts of efficiency gained through coordination and shared priors. They can be considerated as a collective level resource-rational solution (resource here is communication)
