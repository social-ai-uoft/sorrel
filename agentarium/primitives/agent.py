    """
    An abstract class for agents, a special type of entities. Note that this is a subclass of Entity.

    Attributes:
        - :attr:`cfg` - The configuration to use for this agent.
        - :attr:`model` - The model that this agent uses.
        - :attr:`action_space` - The range of actions that the agent is able to take, represented by a list of integers.

            .. warning::
                Currently, each element in :code:`action_space` should be the index of that element.
                In other words, it should be a list of neighbouring integers in increasing order starting at 0.

                For example, if the agent has 4 possible actions, it should have :code:`action_space = [0, 1, 2, 3]`.

    Attributes that override parent (Entity)'s default values:
        - :attr:`vision` - set at time of initialization based on the cfg provided, instead of defaulting to None.
        - :attr:`has_transitions` - Defaults to True instead of False.
