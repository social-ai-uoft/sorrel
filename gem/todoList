Version 0.1.0
I think that this as it stands may be ready for push to main branch

Version 0.1.1
Things that need to be done

1) need to add priority replay. This is critical for sparse environments, and many
    of projects are comparing to this gold standard
2) need to send some of this to GPUs to get some speed up. This is very CPU intensive
    but getting savings where we can will be important, especially with the integrated
    M1 chips
3) need to make new environments and test generalization
4) need to make the neural networks slightly more flexible. At the moment, we will keep
    CNN input, LSTM, Fully connected, double DQN. But, number of layers, etc. should
    be slightly more flexible
