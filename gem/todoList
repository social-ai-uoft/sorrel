------------------------------
Version 0.1.0
This as it stands may be almost ready for push to main branch
gemsWolves_LSTM_DQN.py is current game. 

1) Need to refactor some of the tools at end of script into DQN_utils.py
2) separate out the running the scripts and the game script
3) remove phantom code (scripts that no longer are used, imports that are not needed)

------------------------------
Version 0.1.1
Things that need to be done

1) need to add priority replay. This is critical for sparse environments, and many
    of projects are comparing to this gold standard
2) need to send some of this to GPUs to get some speed up. This is very CPU intensive
    but getting savings where we can will be important, especially with the integrated
    M1 chips
3) need to make new environments and test generalization
4) need to include proper comments and use named variables in function calls
5) need to make the neural networks slightly more flexible. At the moment, we will keep
    CNN input, LSTM, Fully connected, double DQN. But, number of layers, etc. should
    be slightly more flexible
6) create documentation and example tutorials
7) change all the varables and functions to be in current python conventions (shon says there is script for this)
8) move the agent replay memory update in the wolf transitions into the agent.died() [the memory transfer can happen before the agent.kind turns into a deadAgent)
